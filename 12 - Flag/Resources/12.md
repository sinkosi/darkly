## Location 🗺️

`http://\<ip-address>:80/?page=recover`

## Vulnerability ⚔️

A poorly designed password recovery page. It is susceptible to compromise meaning one could login in easily and steal information or retrieve which emails have active accounts.

## Method 🧾

The page shows only a Submit button and a mailbox. When you inspect the code you will see a few things but mainly:

```html
<form action="#" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="mail" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">
  <input type="submit" name="Submit" value= "Submit">
</form>
```

If you change the type from hidden to text, it will appear on your screen. Ideally a fix would be changing it to email. The content already has a value set rather than a placeholder. Changing the value and submitting results in the flag being returned.

The other issue is that there is a limit of 15 characters which is small and makes it easier to guess when one subtracts an email suffix i.e @gmail.com, @hotmail.com or @borntosec.co.za

## Fix 🔧

- Return a consistent message for both existent and non-existent accounts.
- Ensure that the time taken for the user response message is uniform.
- Use a side-channel to communicate the method to reset their password.
- Use URL tokens for the simplest and fastest implementation.
- Ensure that generated tokens or codes are:
  - Randomly genererated using a cryptographically safe algorithm.
  - Sufficiently long to protect against brute-force attacks.
  - Stored securely.
  - Single use and expire after an appropriate period.

It is also important to use a placeholder rather than a value. Ensure that there is a validator to make sure it is a valid email, provide standard feedback regardless of whether the recovery was successful or not.

Return a link and not the actual password, or use two-factor authentication.
